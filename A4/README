The final executable was compiled on machine gl33

# Compilation
Run the following commands to compile the program:
	$ premake4 gmake
	$ make

Run the following command to invoke the program:
	$ ./A3 Assets/lua_file_name
  (Note: need to run the program in A3 directory and pass the lua file with "Assets/" as prefix)

# Manual
Background:
I use a background image 'background.png' to be mapped as the default background.

Acceleration:
I use bounded box to bound each mesh and use an intersection check with the bounded box first before doing intersect with the mesh.

Extra features are as followed:
	1. Antialiasing: I use supersampling to generate 9 rays for each pixel, sample on a 3x3 grid over the area of the pixel and take the average of the nine colour for the output.
  2. Mirror reflection: I issue secondary flection rays from the point of intersection 10 times and I assume that a phone material with shininess of 128 is purly reflective. For each reflection, I use the following formula to calculate the light: 
    colour = colour * (128 - shininess / 128) +  reflection_colour * shininess / 128;
