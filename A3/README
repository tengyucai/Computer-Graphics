# Manual
Meets all objectives listed in the assignment description.

I create a new puppet Baymax (Assets/puppet.lua) which is the character from the 3D computer-animated film "Big Hero 6". All the components used are white spheres. The Hierarchy is as below:

			      torso
                /   |   \
            leftLeg |  rightLeg
                    |
                 shoulder
                /   |    \
               /   head   \
      leftUpperArm       rightUpperArm
            |                  |
      leftLowerArm       rightLowerArm
      /  |   |   \         /   |   |  \
finger   |   |  finger finger  |   |  finger
     finger finger         finger finger


There are 16 degrees of freedom in total:
Legs      - 2
Shoulder  - 1
Head      - 1
UpperArms - 2
LowerArms - 2
Fingers   - 8


I add two new fields to the JointNode class: angle_x and angle_y to keep track of the current x or y angle.
I also create a new Command class as the realization of the command pattern.

I highlight all the selected node with yellow material.
I assume that after switching to Position/Orientation mode from Joints mode, all the selected nodes will not be cleared and will remain highlighted.


Extra features are as followed:
	N/A
